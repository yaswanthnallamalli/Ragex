Issue Description: SCW - Profile - JDBC Connection issues.
Business Impact: Client is observing latencies and is impacting Apps from CET Capability APIs to Schwab Mobile Middleware (MoM), CET Capability APIs which is not a good client experience.

Client Action: NA.
FIS Action:  CIM initiated the bridge and engaged Client Care API Support & Profile PO App Support to triage the issue. Karen Anderson Profile PO App Support joined and suggested to page - Profile - PO Web – US as she didn't see any SCAER errors. Jennilene Pol from Care API Support joined the call and checking the logs and requested to collect the UUID details from the client. Further, Jason Kassab joined the call for further assistance and shared his detailed analysis. As per Jason, as the client has already confirmed that the errors started from 12:00 PM ET and they have stopped at 01:30 PM ET on 02/08. After analyzing the data provided by the client, it was found that there was no FIS environment issue between 12:30 PM - 1:30 PM ET. There could be some issue in the Charles Schwab Bank, SSB's environment as their devices could not reach FIS. However, if they feel there was any issue on the FIS side, please provide us more details/examples/data that demonstrates that something was wrong within the FIS environment.
Hence, CIM will mark this case as resolved under the ""Client Owned issue"". No PR required.

Issue Description: GETPAID - Emails not being send out of GetPaid PRD.
Business Impact: GetPaid emails are not being sent out of get paid production to the customers due to a SMTP Authentication issue. The customers get the GETPAID A/R reports using these emails from the GetPaid PRD and failing to receive the GETPAID A/R reports is impacting their business.

Client Action: NA.
FIS Action:  CIM joined the bridge initiated by Moore, Alan joined from GP Cx T1 and engaged GP SAAS & Windows Virtual Cloud Support to triage the issue. Further, Cumbus, Justin R & Belton, Paul joined from GP Dev team discovered that this issue could be due to the version upgrade for Cashapp recently on Saturday. Hence, as per Cumbus, Justin R - Preliminary root cause: Upgrade on seventh occured. We populated new system property named 'SMTP.MAIL.START.TLS' . The default is false and that is the same we noticed in the system properties table. We updated the false value to true to indicate we intend to get a TLS session as opposed to a unencrypted connection. Further, Moore, Alan checked with the client ""Victaulic Co"" and confirmed that their issue is not resolved yet and SAAS team will have to restart the service now. However, since the issue is for one client currently, GP SAAS/Cx T1 team decided to perform the service restart in off business hours.
CIM is on stand-by and currently waiting for the next updates from the SAAS team to perform the service restart in off business hours (after 6 PM ET).

On 02/13, as per Kumar, BandaruRushyendra from SAAS both the servers' services restarted (Cashapp). However, as per the latest updates shared by the Kerfouf, Youcef; from GP CX T1 the client is still facing issue after the service restart. CIM bridge reconvene at 9:05 AM ET. Cumbus, Justin R from Dev, Moore, Alan; from GP Cx T1, Kumar, BandaruRushyendra; from SAAS joined the call to check the latest logs for this issue. Cumbus, Justin R; from GP Dev checked the logs and it was discovered that it was a different error yesterday. However, as per the todays logs it looks like a permission issue that client needs to correct that on their end. It's saying that out email address getpaid-smtp@dictate.com cannot send on behalf of seth.eisenberg@collections.victaulic.com. This looks like purely this is just a smtp issue at this point on the customer side. But that (554 5.2.252 - the subcode) right here is what they need to focus on right there.

Issue Description: Corp 4E - BASE2000 Outage
Business Impact: All of the users are uanable to access the website on the bank's network which is impacting their business production.
Client Action: NA.
FIS Action:  CIM initiated the bridge and engaged NOC team to triage the issue. As suggested by NOC, CIM paged - BASE2000 Tier 2 Support (Credit Client Care Notification Group). Osorio, Stefany, joined and suggested CIM to page TSG – STC Card Midrange support. Koppula, SnehaReddy & Ali, Tahir joined from TSG – STC Card Midrange support and can see everything is fine on the Application side.
The FIS network and Application teams have checked the shared traceroute logs and can see that the traffic is still within the client's network. It's not living the client's network from the network side. Hence, the client was suggested to check who manages their VPN tunnel and who is their Tunnel provider? Also, if they can check with their network team and confirm if the traffic is leaving their Firewall?
Further, at 3:23 PM ET the FIS network team has confirmed that they can see an active connection coming from the client right now hitting the FIS router.
CIM has send a note to the client to check and confirm the same.
Further, as suggested by SDM Wright, Todd, it was due to a hardware issue on the client side. Hence, CIM has marked this case as resolved under client owned issue.

	• Users have the latest app, but it won't let them do anything. As soon as they open it, they're prompted to update. When they go to the App Store, they're only given the options to uninstall or open the app. When they try to update, it redirects them back to the same message, creating a loop that prevents any further action. This issue needs immediate attention to resolve the update loop and restore app functionality. 
	• The latest release of our mobile app [6.0.0.4907], launched on 2/20/2025, is currently inaccessible to all Android users. Users are unable to update the app, with the Play Store only offering 'Uninstall' or 'Open' options. Even after uninstalling and reinstalling, the error persists, preventing users from logging in or reaching the login screen. This issue affects Android Version 14, as evidenced by the attached screenshot. Immediate resolution is critical to restore functionality and user satisfaction.
	• Anderson-Blair, Diane removed the force upgrade setup BPS100000287 for client as per direction on the call. Confirmed from Diane that all force upgrade configurations in AWS have been removed and this resolved the issue. 
	• Reason : Lesley, Brian updated that The reason why this was an issue is that with the February release the mobile version number changed from 6.0.#### to 6.0.0.####.  Since this changed and there were some existing Force Upgrade rules in AWS with the old version as a minimum version this caused the validation of version to think the new mobile upgrade version was lower than the force upgrade setting and therefore wouldn't allow the upgrade.  To resolve this, we removed the existing Force Upgrade rule in AWS so that would allow the user to upgrade to the new version.

The FIS Implementation team has removed the existing force upgrade rule that was causing the issue. The issue was resolved at 9:25 PM EST, and after thorough testing, we were able to access the application completely. The issue has been resolved, and the client has validated the same.

Issue Description: 10479+ transaction on hold and IMS H database is full
Business Impact: Risk of transaction timeout due to DB being full
  
Action Taken: Cap1 reported that they saw 10479+ transactions on hold. Team identified that IMS H database was full. So EFT ISS & Mainframe BDOC teams were engaged to run a purge job in order to free up space on that database. Mark from OA Mainframe Team executed purge job CBH31A at 01:01 ET 12/17 and we started seeing improvement within the stand in space and stand-in queue started dropping.
Support teams have added new monitoring which gives visibility to command center of current free capacity every 30 minutes. Monitoring triggers alert if we hit 10% free capacity to Command Center and Dedicated Team so there is time for necessary action to address the issue.

Issue Description: Amalgamated Bank - Digital One - SFTP file not received in AOTM - CCPU Retirement.
Business Impact: SFTP files did not make it to the AOTM system, which caused the checks to fall into the exception queue and fail to process those files successfully. The affected amount is $8 million dollars and is extremely urgent as the customer is being impacted negatively.

Client Action: NA.
FIS Action:  CIM initiated the bridge and engaged BeB L2 Client Support & BeB Service Delivery to triage the issue. Further, as discussed on the call with Thomas, Myron; and Becker, Pamela J; the two files were sent to D1B with the File Definitions as AB_ARPP. However, as per the FIS support the only definition in the company is ARP_PP, AB File Specs -FixedFormat. So this is an user error and FIS cannot fix this issue. So, the client will have to resubmit the files with an ARP_PP in the header record of the file that was received in D1B FTP. Further, SDM Osorio, Erik; has updated the client with this information. CIM will mark this case as resolved. No PR required.

Donna Naborowski joined the call, reviewed the case, and advised paging Loyalty Prod Support, but no one joined. Another similar issue was reported, and Donna confirmed it was the same. Jean Canot and Helen Mootry joined, with Helen noting that Carl from the implementations team confirmed no changes on the eZCard. IT Midrange needs to check for issues, and if none are found, Loyalty and DIH need to troubleshoot. Jean advised paging the DIH team, and Amy suggested paging TSG – STC Card Midrange support. At 17:54 on 2/12/2025, Jean verified SSO login functionality. The issue seems related to a certificate swap on DIH, requiring HINDA to update the certificate on file.

Blake Hutchinson joined the call at 17:57, noting connectivity issues with SSO from LOB to eZCard to ScoreCard Rewards. Investigation revealed a new certificate swap last night, causing the issue. The certificate was updated before DIHSI completed their part, breaking website connections. At 18:10, the DIH certificate swap for production was being updated. The support team ran a script to reapply the cert on production, completing the update at 18:18. The script was still running at 18:25. CIM requested the HINDA Vendor ticket number, but the support team stated the work was done via email. The certificate applied on 2/11 at 6:15 PM Central time. By 18:50, Gaby Macias successfully logged in. DIH certificate was updated by HINDA on 2/11, and DIH team updated their certificate on 2/12, resolving the login issue for clients.",Unknown,2025-02-13 09:07:30,2025,Unknown

An internal reconvene has been setup for 10 AM for CS05815148. CIM joined the 10 AM ET reconvene for CS05815148 to discuss the current status and next actions on this issue. Further, Avula, Tarun; from the eBanking Service Delivery is checking with the Bankway team if yesterday was a working day assigned for this bank -AmeriServ Financial Bank. As per ?Avula, Tarun; P1 CS05816113 is not related to the ongoing issue on this call. The (29T) AmeriServ Financial Bank was closed yesterday as per BANKWAY operations. Hence, the AmeriServ Financial Bank would see all the missing transactions and balance corrections tonight after 12 when the batch load completes. 
Note: As per Avula, Tarun; this is not an issue. the flow is working as expected. It's just bank forgot the holiday process. Once the batch process is done tonight things should fix for this bank.

Unspecified Applications,BSG,No Known Alert,FIS,Priority 4,Application,Service portal,P1C file causing errors in Horizon when auto-processing,FIS,Solved (workaround),Transmission failure,unknown,"Horizon Dev team confirmed that there were no changes on their side. The Credit P1C team restaged the file, and the client downloaded it, but unfortunately, the same error occurred during processing in HORIZON. The FIS teams regrouped and identified that one of the columns for the expiration date was in the wrong format.
According to Rick, there were 55 banks on CD250, with only one on the Horizon interface, and a few banks were impacted on the CC interface. As advised by Williams, David A engaged Rintoule, Vaughan to check if any changes were made on CD250, as mainframe development expertise was needed. Rintoule, Vaughan reviewed the logs and confirmed a defect in CSIPONEC-131647 and released a fix. Not all banks will experience this issue, as the problematic column is not required in the file for all banks.
Per CSIPONEC-135664, the release notes indicated changes were made to the interface files CDS110, CDS120, CDS180, and CDS250. Rintoule, Vaughan suggested sending the recreated files to the affected banks and engaging developers to address the issue. For the remaining interface files, a permanent fix will be included in today's patch.

Resolution: FIS teams made emergency change and reverted the expiration date field with zeros.  A full file was delivered to the client reporting impact, allowing them to have current data for all accounts, with the expected file format.

Connex ASG implemented it and confirmed that at 09:55 ET the declines started going down.
Client validated and confirmed resolution.
